# Citi Bike Analytics

The New York Citi Bike Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. This project is an analysis using a Tableau story to answer the questions:
1.	Where in the city are users biking?
2.	What are the most and least popular stations?
3.	What does the Citi Bike customer base look like?
4.	What does Citi Bike usage look like on each day of the week?

### The Data

The dataset for this project is from the [Citi Bike System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) page on their website. I took CSVs from each month in 2019 (January – August were the only months available at the time of this analysis), and used Python and Pandas to combine into one single CSV for the year. That CSV was then used to create the Tableau visualizations.

I do not have the actual CSVs used uploaded into this repository due to GitHub’s size restrictions. If you would like to see how the data cleanup was done, check out the Jupyter Notebook file.
